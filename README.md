# cserver

A simple practice console chat program written in Rust; server program, paired with the "cclient" program.

* 0.1.0: Preliminary design: Basic code structure, single-client communication, log-in routine; works with "cclient 0.1.0".
* 0.2.0: Small updates to support modifications made in "cserver"; works with "cserver 0.2.0"
* 0.3.0: Cleaned up and refactored code, minor improvements; works with "cserver 0.3.0"

Improvement ideas:
* Text colorization
* Password hiding during input
* Implementation of commands
